## ðŸ“– Introduction

### What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an implementation of functionalities of **Machine Learning (ML)** that enables computers to "understand" and process human language. Translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation are examples of NLP.

This area of study is on a constant rise and extremely hard. This is why currently the most part of advancements in NLP are made by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

### Why NLP is hard?

The language is **ambiguous**. The same word can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, the word "bank" can mean a financial institution or a river bank.
