# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 📖 Introduction

### 📝 What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an implementation of functionalities of **Machine Learning (ML)** that enables computers to "understand" and process human language. Translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation are examples of NLP.

This area of study is on a constant rise and extremely hard. This is why currently the most part of advancements in NLP are made by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

### 📝 Why NLP is hard?

The language is **ambiguous**. The same word can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, the word "bank" can mean a financial institution or a river bank.

Other problem is **irony**. The same sentence can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, the sentence "He studied by 10 minutes, certainly will pass in the exam" can be ironic or not depending on the context.

And, at last, the language is **dynamic**. New words are created and old words are forgotten all the time.

### 📝 Applications of NLP

The applications of NLP are countless. Here are some examples:

- Translation
- Sentiment Analysis
- Speech Recognition
- Topic Segmentation
- Question Answering
- Text Summarization
- Text Generation and Prediction
- Text Classification
- Chatbots
